### Eyes Animation

#### Description

This is a project for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding, where given a starter code, two eyes are styled and animated to follow the cursor as it moves across the screen



#### How to Run

Once you navigate to the page, the eyes should follow the cursor as you move the mouse


#### Roadmap of Future Improvements

Work on more complex designs for the eye animation; animate moving objects that are not anchored in place but follow the cursor; improve the styles
